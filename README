WHAT'S IN THIS DIRECTORY

These are files I referenced during my LSPE talk on combining Nagios and
Puppet to restart services automatically.. 

FILES:
auth.conf: puppet authentication file.. this contains the stanza for /run
commands.cfg: snippet of nagios config to add the handle_puppetrun script
handle_puppetrun.sh: the script that goes into the Nagios plugins dir
httpd.pp: The puppet class for the apache webserver
puppet.conf: The puppet agent section of the global puppet config file
services.cfg: the nagios service definition for our puppet handler

DEBUGGING COMMANDS:

For debugging, on your webserver you can use this command line. You will 
need to use sudo or run it as root. You may or may not need the '--fqdn 
`hostname`' depending on your configuration.

/usr/sbin/puppetd --listen --verbose --no-daemonize --no-client --fqdn `hostname`

Then on your nagios node you can run this to make sure the invocation is 
working. You may have to use sudo or run it as root - as it needs access 
to the puppet certs to run. In my configuration I've added the nagios user 
to the sudoers file so that it can run the command as root.

puppetrun -a --host cato.rage.net

You can also trigger the handle_puppetrun shell script manually, via:

sudo -u nagios /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/handle_puppetrun.sh CRITICAL HARD cato.rage.net 1
